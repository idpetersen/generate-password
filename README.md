# generate-password

This program generates a random password from 8 to 128 characters long. Using while loops, for loops and if statements. 

The user will input a number between 8 and 128 and have a choice of using uppercase and lowercase letters along with symbols and numbers. 

A HUUUGE thank you to Carter Morfitt for walking me through while loops. Without him, I was trying to create seperate functions for pulling elements out of each option's arrays. 

What I have learned through this experience is to not overthink the process and to work from the bottom up. Overall, a horribly stressfull experience turned into a huge victory for myself. Thank you to all that worked with me for hours at a time. It takes a village...

As a javascript program, this random password generator is the best in the business. Come on down and invest in our company.
